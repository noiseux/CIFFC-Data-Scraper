# CIFFC-Data-Scraper
This python script collects a wide array of data and statistics from the CIFFC National Fire Situational Report and reports them in a tabular format that can easily be used on ArcGIS Online Notebooks and automated through Tasks. The data can then be included and displayed within web applications, such as Dashboards.
